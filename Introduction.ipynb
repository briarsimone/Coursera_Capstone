    "### Minneapolis is a city rich in culture. Though overlooked by most, it is a great city, diverse in its roots. Throughout this project, I will explore how diverse Minneapolis is in its types of cuisines. This data could help people who visit Minneapolis by showing them where they should go for different types of cuisine. Additionally, it will show current residents which types are lacking as well as which are thriving. "
